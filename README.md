## SPECIALITY_CLASSIFIER_POC

#### Description: 

This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a text classification project. The project involves splitting the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building and benchmarking text classification models, and deploying a FastAPI-based API for model inference. Data is sent for inference via RabbitMQ, and results are stored in a local PostgreSQL database.
